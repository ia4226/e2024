1. The COVID-19 pandemic, emerging in late 2019, caused severe impacts on health, the economy, and psychology, leading to about 7 million deaths globally by mid-2023.  
2. It was the third leading cause of death in the US during the first two years, prompting strict social-distancing measures that crippled businesses and increased unemployment.  
3. High rates of anxiety, depression, and stress were reported globally, exacerbated by unemployment concerns, which significantly affected mental health.  
4. Many sentiment analysis studies have explored public emotions on social media during the pandemic, but few analyzed unemployment perception in mainstream media.  
5. A study based on *The New York Times* articles in 2020 used sentiment and discourse analysis to track how unemployment was emotionally represented and evolved during the pandemic.  
6. Using Python and the NRC Emotion Lexicon, the study extracted sentiments and emotions monthly, identifying patterns and themes linked to unemployment-related coverage.  
7. Unemployment rates peaked at 14.7% in April 2020, paralleling a surge in *NYT* coverage, highlighting media's reflection of pandemic-induced economic crises.  
8. Results showed a correlation between unemployment rates and media coverage, emphasizing a negativity bias in economic reporting during the crisis.
