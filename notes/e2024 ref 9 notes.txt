- Exponential growth of web data necessitates sentiment analysis for actionable insights.  
- Sentiment analysis categorizes opinions for better understanding, primarily focusing on binary classification.  
- Existing research emphasizes English and European languages; Arabic, especially Dialectal Arabic, is underexplored.  
- Arabic comprises Classical Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), and Dialectal Arabic, with significant regional variations.  
- Focus on Algerian dialects, including regional sub-dialects with linguistic peculiarities.  
- Objective: Classify online comments in Algerian Arabic newspapers into positive or negative sentiments.  
- Data sources: SANA corpus (created for study) and OCA corpus (MSA-based).  
- Classification techniques: SVM, NB, KNN with preprocessing like stemming and n-grams.  
- OCA corpus: TF/TF-IDF improved SVM and KNN, NB excelled with term-occurrence models; stemming had minimal effect.  
- SANA corpus: Stemming benefited mixed-content texts; n-grams provided limited improvements due to linguistic diversity.  
- Stemming effectiveness varies by corpus type and document homogeneity.  
- Future focus: Enhancing corpus representation and leveraging semantically rich sections for improved classification.
